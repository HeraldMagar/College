            Battle Royale
            The game also includes battle royale modes featuring up to 100 players. A player can choose to play alone, on a two-man
             team, or in a four-man squad. At the start of a game, all players choose an ability from healing to making a launch pad.
              Once all 100 people are ready, they get aboard a plane that flies in a straight line over the map. This flight path 
              changes every game. Every team is automatically given a jump leader who decides when and where the team will land.
               At the beginning of the game, each player carries only a knife. The map has weapons, vehicles, and items which
                players can find and use to improve their chances of killing enemies while staying alive themselves. The mode 
                has high tier loot zones (marked in yellow on the map) that provide players with better items. The safe zone on
                 the map shrinks as the game progresses, with players who remain outside the safe zone being killed if they stay
                  outside for too long. A player or team wins the game if they are the last one remaining. Particularly, battle

            A Zombies mode was added in November 2019. It featured one map called Shi No Numa. It placed teams of players against
             zombies that attacked in waves. It was playable in Endless Survival Mode, which ran like the classic Zombies experience, 
             and Raid Mode, which threw a set number of waves at the players before transitioning to a boss encounter.
              The players could choose whether to play it on Normal or Heroic difficulty. The mode was removed in March 2020 due to
               it not reaching the desired level of quality. Undead Siege, a zombie survival mode, was added into the game in August
